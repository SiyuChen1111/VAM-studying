```
Raw LIM data (CSV)
  ├─ image_path → VGG16 feature extraction (128×128×3 → 25088-d features)
  ├─ stimulus_image → cached feature vector
  ├─ target_labels (ground truth: L/R/U/D)
  ├─ response_labels (human response: L/R/U/D)
  └─ true_rt (human reaction time, seconds)
         │
         ▼
  Data/age_groups_matched/20-29/
  ├─ train_data.csv (N≈94,737 rows)
  └─ test_data.csv  (N≈33,134 rows)
```

### 2.2 Training Pipeline

```
Phase 1: Stage 1 (VGG) Training
  ├─ If checkpoint exists → load and freeze
  ├─ If not → train from pretrained VGG16
  │   ├─ Loss: CrossEntropy(target_labels, logits)
  │   ├─ Epochs: 5–50 (task-dependent)
  │   └─ Output: best_model.pth
  └─ Result: ~95% classification accuracy

Phase 2: Stage 2 (Wong-Wang) Fitting
  ├─ Freeze Stage 1 VGG weights
  ├─ For each scale in [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45]:
  │   ├─ Transform logits → softplus_centered(logits × scale)
  │   ├─ Run Wong-Wang dynamics (500 steps, dt=10ms)
  │   ├─ Apply soft_index readout → pred_rt, choice
  │   ├─ Compute loss: response_nll + rt_mse (+ optional behavioral)
  │   └─ Backward through DiffDecisionMultiClass (implicit-function gradient)
  ├─ Select best scale by total_score or behavior_optimal_score
  └─ Output: best WW checkpoint + evaluation metrics
```

### 2.3 Key Technical Details

**Gradient flow through threshold crossing:**
- `DiffDecisionMultiClass` uses implicit function theorem: `d(crossing_time)/d(trajectory) = −1 / dsdt` at crossing point
- Batch elements where no class crosses threshold receive zero gradient
- The backward multiplies through by `dt` for correct chain-rule scaling

**Soft-index readout** (key innovation over baseline):
- Decouples "which class" from "when" — choice comes from amplitude-weighted evidence, not just crossing order
- Gaussian soft-index centered on each class's first-crossing time
- RT = probability-weighted average of per-class decision times
- Enabled by parameter: `sigma_s = 0.05s`, `choice_temperature = 0.10`

**t0 non-decision time shift:**
- Fixed t0 = 0.15s added to all predicted RTs
- Accounts for sensory encoding + motor execution latency
- `t0_mode = 'fixed_global'` avoids learned-t0 instability

## 3. Results: Best Configuration

### 3.1 Absolute Winner: B3 (fixed t0=0.15s)

**Configuration:**
- Stage 1: VGG16, pretrained, frozen
- Stage 2 input: `softplus_centered` transform, scale=0.183
- Readout: `soft_index`, sigma_s=0.05, choice_temperature=0.10
- t0: fixed_global = 0.15s
- Behavioral penalties: none (pure response_nll + rt_mse)
- Train: matched 20-29, 15 epochs WW, 0.15 train fraction

**Results (on matched 20-29 test set):**

| Metric | Model (B3) | Human | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Behavioral Optimal Score** | **0.592** | 1.0 (oracle) | — |
| Predicted Mean RT | 0.578s | 0.624s | −0.046s |
| Predicted Median RT | 0.571s | 0.601s | −0.030s |
| Model Accuracy | 1.000 | 0.950 | +0.050 |
| Response Agreement | 0.950 | 0.950 | 0.000 |
| Congruency RT Gap | 0.074s | 0.041s | +0.033s |
| Error−Correct ΔRT | **+0.389s** | **−0.058s** | **wrong sign** |
| Q90 | 0.715s | 0.700s | +0.015s |
| Q95 | 0.772s | 0.750s | +0.022s |
| Q99 | 0.887s | 1.001s | −0.114s |

**What B3 gets right:**
- RT mean and median close to human (~0.05s gap)
- RT distribution quantiles (Q90/Q95) well-aligned
- Response agreement equals human (0.95)
- Congruency gap in right ballpark (0.07 vs 0.04)
- Stable: fixed t0 avoids learned-parameter drift

**What B3 gets wrong:**
- Model accuracy = 1.0 (human = 0.95) — model never makes spontaneous errors
- Error−Correct ΔRT = +0.389s — model errors are **slower** than correct responses, opposite to human pattern (errors faster by 0.058s)
- Q99 saturated at 0.89s (insufficient tail)
- Congruency gap ~2× human magnitude

| pred_mean | 0.590s |
| model_accuracy | 0.999 |
| response_agreement | 0.949 |
| error−correct ΔRT | +0.367s |
| cong_gap | 0.101s |

## 4. What Was Tried and Why It Didn't Surpass B3

### 4.1 Readout-Only Changes
- **soft_hazard**: collapsed RT scale (pred_mean ~0.2s)
- **urgency (additive/collapsing)**: preserved scale but worsened skew and error structure
- **Conclusion**: readout alone cannot fix the underlying evidence dynamics

### 4.2 Stage-2 Internal Parameter Probes
- **noise_ampa sweep** (0.02 → 0.06): created error regime but ΔRT sign remained wrong
- **threshold lowering**: preserved errors, worsened RT scale
- **competition scaling**: moved secondary metrics, no fundamental change
- **Conclusion**: single WW knobs insufficient

### 4.3 RT Distribution Shape Losses
- **soft_hist_kl, cdf_wasserstein, conditional CDF**: moved selected checkpoint, but no errors created
- **Conclusion**: shape-aware losses have signal, but not enough alone

### 4.4 Behavioral Penalty Weight Sweep (A1–A3)
- **1× penalties (A1)**: best single config with penalties, ΔRT=+0.367
- **2× penalties (A2)**: eliminated error regime entirely (acc=1.0, ΔRT=NaN)
- **4× penalties (A3)**: collapsed RT scale (pred_mean=0.473s)
- **Conclusion**: penalizing errors without a mechanism for error generation is counterproductive

### 4.5 DMC Psychological Mechanism (D1–D4)
- Tested early flanker capture + late cognitive control
- Stronger DMC parameters eliminated errors (not created more)
- Only D1 (moderate parameters) produced errors at all, with wrong sign
- **Conclusion**: Stage-2 selection mechanism needs Stage-1 evidence uncertainty to produce fast errors

### 4.6 SPEA GRU-Accumulator (c0–c4)
- 5 variants: weighted evidence, accuracy calibration, hard-stop readout, multi-sequence evidence, semi-supervised consistency
- All hit the same hard floor: accuracy 22–44%, response_agreement 20–41%
- **Conclusion**: GRU accumulator architecture is the bottleneck — it loses ~55% of Stage-1 evidence quality

### 4.7 Variational Evidence → Wong-Wang Synthesis (Phase 15)
- Fed time-varying variational (stochastic) evidence directly into WW dynamics, bypassing the SPEA accumulator
- **Breakthrough**: WW preserves evidence quality ~2.5× better than SPEA (64% vs 25% accuracy)
- Response agreement improves ~30% (0.54 vs 0.41) — WW's 4×4 learned J_matrix preserves evidence structure
- RT scale is calibratable (1.2–4.9s, needs threshold/noise tuning)
- Error regime still absent — variational sigma ~0.28 not yet sufficient for fast-error dynamics
- **Conclusion**: The GRU accumulator is definitively the architecture bottleneck. WW + stochastic evidence is the promising path forward; the remaining gaps (RT scale, error regime) are known-calibratable WW parameters.

---

## 5. Main Limitations and Root Causes

### 5.1 The Error-Direction Problem (HARDEST)

**Observation**: Across all 16 evaluated configurations and all prior experiments:
- Model error−correct ΔRT is **always positive** (+0.35 to +0.52)
- Human error−correct ΔRT is **negative** (−0.058s)
- This means: the model's errors are slow, deliberate mistakes; human errors are fast, automatic responses

**Root cause**: Stage 1 (VGG16) produces deterministic, high-quality logits that make the correct answer trivially distinguishable from distractors. Without evidence uncertainty at the input level, no Stage-2 mechanism can produce the human "fast error" pattern where flanker-driven automatic responses beat deliberate control.

**Evidence**: The DMC experiment (Phase D) directly tested this — even with explicit early flanker capture + late cognitive control, stronger DMC parameters eliminated errors instead of creating fast errors.

### 5.2 Accuracy Ceiling Effect

**Observation**: Model accuracy is almost always 0.995–1.000 (human = 0.950).
- The VGG logits are too clean — the correct class dominates by a wide margin
- Wong-Wang competition with learned J_matrix further amplifies the correct signal
- Without evidence noise or ambiguity, the model never makes spontaneous errors

### 5.3 RT Tail Truncation

**Observation**: Q99 (slowest 1% of RTs) is consistently below human:
- B3: 0.887s vs human 1.001s
- Model RT distribution lacks the heavy right tail characteristic of human RT distributions

**Possible cause**: Wong-Wang threshold crossing at 500 steps forces a hard time ceiling. The soft-index readout's Gaussian weighting around first-crossing time further suppresses late crossings.

### 5.4 Congruency Gap Over-Estimation

**Observation**: Model congruency gap ~0.07–0.10s vs human ~0.04s.
- The model shows stronger flanker interference than humans do
- This suggests the competition dynamics are too sensitive to input differences between congruent and incongruent trials

## 6. Promising Future Direction: Variational Evidence → WW

A recent synthesis smoke experiment (`2026-05-05`) demonstrated a breakthrough finding:

**Key result**: Feeding variational (stochastic) evidence sequences directly into Wong-Wang dynamics preserves evidence quality ~2.5× better than the SPEA GRU accumulator.

| Variant | Accuracy | Resp Agree | ΔRT | Pred Mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Var→WW v2 (120 steps) | **0.637** | **0.539** | +0.009 | 1.18s |
| SPEA best (c1) | 0.438 | 0.408 | −0.006 | 0.370s |
| Static B3 (best) | 1.000 | 0.950 | +0.389 | 0.578s |

**Implications:**
1. WW's explicit 4-population competition with learned J_matrix preserves evidence structure much better than GRU-based accumulation
2. Variational evidence introduces the stochasticity that static VGG logits lack (sigma ~0.28)
3. RT scale needs calibration (threshold, J_ext, noise_ampa sweep) but is a known-calibratable parameter
4. Error regime direction remains unresolved — the variational uncertainty may or may not be sufficient to create fast-error dynamics in WW

**Remaining work:**
- WW parameter sweep on variational evidence (threshold × noise × competition)
- t0 calibration
- Behavioral-loss weight testing in combination
- If smoke gates clear → promote to full matched 20-29 surface

## 8. Executive Summary

The current best model (B3) achieves a behavioral optimal score of 0.592 — the highest across all 16 evaluated configurations and all prior experiment phases. It correctly reproduces human RT mean/median, response agreement, and distribution quantiles, but suffers from a fundamental limitation: **the model never makes spontaneous errors, and when forced into error regimes, its errors are slower than correct responses — the opposite of human behavior**.

After 15 phases of systematic experimentation — spanning readout redesigns, internal parameter probes, distribution-shape losses, behavioral penalty sweeps, DMC psychological mechanisms, SPEA accumulator calibration, successor-branch screening, and HSFA repair audits — the evidence converges on a single conclusion: **further local Stage-2 patching cannot resolve the error-direction problem**. The bottleneck is Stage 1: VGG16 produces evidence that is too deterministic, making the correct answer trivially distinguishable. Stage-1 uncertainty (variational/BNN-like feature sampling) is the justified next planning direction.

The variational evidence → Wong-Wang synthesis smoke provides the first direct evidence that combining stochastic Stage-1 evidence with WW's biologically-grounded competition dynamics is a promising path — accuracy jumps from 25% (SPEA) to 64% — but the error-regime problem remains unresolved even there.
